Creating a Repo

    git init
    git add -A or git add .
    git commit -m “Your Message”
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin http………. (G.R.A.O)
    git push -u origin main (G.P.U.O.M)
     
  
Push to existing
    git remote add origin http.....
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
     


Branching and Merging

    git checkout -b __branchname – creates a branch and switches over to that branch
    git checkout master – switch to the master
    git merge _branchname – merges the branch with the master
    git branch -d branchname – deletes the branch since we don’t need it anymore

*To get back into a branch type git checkout branchname

Cloning

    git clone remote location/url clonename – gets a copy from the remote location and stores it in the clonename directory
    cd clonename
    git remote -v – will list the remote location of where the files came from.
    git fetch – Fetch any new changes that may have been made to the remote (you have to be in the clonename directory before you type git fetch)
    git merge origin/master – brings your local master branch up to speed with the most recent commit on the remote that you fetched.
    git log – to see changes

Extras

    You can type git log to see a list of commits in case you need to go back to a previous version.
    Type git reset 7 digit SHA to erase all previous commits. git log will display the commit that you reset and every commits that comes after.
    You can type git show HEAD to see your most recent commit.
    You can type git diff to see your most current changes and compare it to the last commit.
    Type git checkout HEAD filename will restore that file back to the last commit.
    You can type git reset HEAD filename to remove that file from the staging area (git add) in case you don’t want to commit that change.
